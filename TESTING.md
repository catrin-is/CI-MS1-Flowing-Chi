1 error was detected, I had left an empty ID attribute on the img element. 
This was rectified by the removal of the ID attribute. 
Warning message was also detected due to the section wrapping the img element did not have a h2-h6 element. 
This was rectified by changed the section in question to a div element instead. 

As shown below when re-entered the code into the validator no errors or warning messages are shown.

## Bugs

 - My main issue was when I initially developed the header and footer
   with *bootstrap*. I had a lot of problems with layout and making the
   design responsive across all media screens. This was quickly solved
   with the use of *Flexbox*
   
   Another Bug I had was making the nav bar responsive. I decided to
   solve this with a simple and user friendly drop down menu that's seen
   on all media screens. The main reason to opt for the drop down menu
   on larger screens was simple and clean design on the header. 
   
   Hero image did not scale down the quality of the image on mobile
   devices was poor, to solve this added a media query to hide the image
   
   Had the same issue with the demonstration video so decided to ad a
   media query to also hide on mobile devices 
   
   When browsing the contact us page on a mobile devise the map was too
   big and this created a white space on the right hand side of the
   screen. This was solved by changing the width and height value from
   px to % to allow for flexibility across all screens. Media query was
   also added to the margin on both mobile and ipad screens
