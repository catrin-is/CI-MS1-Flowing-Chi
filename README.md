##Overview## 

This is a website for a fictional Tai Chi business to showcase the exercise. The recent pandemic has highlighted the importance of looking after ones mental health as well as physical health. This websites aims to create a community of likeminded individual with a keen interest health and wellbeing.

##UX##

My goal is to create simplistic design that reflect the health and wellbeing benefits of Tai chi. The user will be introduced to core philosophies and how it will benefit them. User friendly navigation so they can explore the site with ease. Potential new customer can view images of flowing movement being performed as well as a short demo video. There’s updated information on class times and locations. 
After doing some initial research on similar websites of business in the area I wanted the site to reflect the core values of Tai Chi, tranquillity , calmness, ….. I aim to do this by no overwhelming the user with loads of information.
