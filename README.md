Flowing Chi is a fictional Tai Chi studio based in west Wales. Instructor and owner Florence Ryder wanted to offer an alternative way of dealing with stress and mental health. Heightened by the recent pandemic within the local community.




## UX

**Project Goals**

The website will be designed for Thai Chi instructor Florence Ryder to showcase the benefits of ancient martial arts. The focus of the project is to inform users without overwhelming the reader with too much information, this will be achieved through a simple and clean design that promotes health and wellbeing.

**User Story**

 - As a potential customer I want a brief description on the services available as I’m looking to enhance my health and wellbeing.
 
 - As a new site visitor, I want a simple and easy way to navigate through the website.
 
 - As a returning customer I want up to date classes and price information.
 
 - As a site editor I want a simple way of updating information such as offers and class information to ensure customers are informed
 
 - As a potential customer I want to read reviews from others that have used the service
 
 - As a potential or returning customer I want an easy an accessible way of viewing contact information

## Wireframe

I used [figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create the [wireframes](/workspace/CI-MS1-Flowing-Chi/wireframes) 

## Features

**The header:**

Minimalist design consists of a logo and a menu drop down button to allow users to navigate the site.

**Footer:**

Social media icons to allow users to visit social media sites. As this is a fictional site the links are to the home page of the social media sites.

**Index.html**

Hero image - is a coastal landscape, promoting wellbeing and a sense of calm for the user.

Description - Underneath the hero image is a brief description of what Thai Chi and Qigong is

Health Benefits – Circularity is a very important part of Tai Chi movements, I have decided to incorporate circular background throughout the design of the website for this reason.
4 main benefits are displayed here 

Reviews – at the bottom of the home page are the reviews so users can easily see what other people’s experiences are.

**About-us.html**

A calming image of the ocean breaking on some stones with the sunset in the background.

On this page the users can get to know a little bit more about the instructor and her background, this allows users to get to know Flo before attending one of her classes and gives a sense of familiarity.

There are some links at the bottom of the page to allow users to explore more on the topic in their own time.

**Gallery.html**

The images displayed on this page -Qigong moves demonstrated by Flo at Tanybwlch beach

**Classes.html**

Video link to Bruce Frantiz, expert instructor, demonstrating some Thai chi. This is accompanied by a brief description taken from Bruce Frantiz's website

Class times and locations are displayed mimicking the circles on the home page to create consistency throughout the site

Prices – again are displayed in a grey circular background

**Contact us.html**

Another coastal image displayed to create consistency throughout the site

Contact form to allow users to contact the studio with any questions or concerns (please note as this is a fictional business the form doesn’t work)

Map and a link to google maps to allow users to easily locate the studio

Contact information – allow users to easily contact the studio

**Features left to implement**

Build an online community through online classes and blog. This will be on a separate page.

Implement an online booking system so it’s easier for users to book online classes.
